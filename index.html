    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <script src="index.js"></script>
    <!--referencing the JS file created-->
    <!--Comment1: Ensure you put this script element at the end of body element,for better user experience-->
    <!--Reason1 is that the browser parses the file from top to bottom,so the browser might get busy parsing the javascript code instead of giving the content of the page(loading and giving white space)
    Reason2 is that always the code in between the <script></script> element needs to talk to the elements on the Webpage, e.g we may want to show or hide some elements, so adding the js code at end of body element makes it easier for all web content to be rendered by the browser-->
    <!--It is recommended that you have the JS in a separate file[just like long code for CSS]-->
